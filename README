Lily Data Connector Service
===========================
This is a partial implementation of the SCAPE RESTful Data Connector API for a Lily repository (http://www.lilyproject.org/).

Requirements
============
Java 1.7
maven 2.0
Lily 2.0
This code has only been tested on Linux

Installation
============
Clone this project locally to {dc-lily-home}

Configure the application here:
  {dc-lily-home}/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml
Set the REST endpoint with <url-pattern> tag; default is /*

  {dc-lily-home}/src/properties.config
Configure the thread pool here. Do not change the lily endpoint if you are working with the test version

Build the dc-lily .war file:
  mvn war:war

Download the Lily 2.0 distribution from http://www.lilyproject.org/lily/ext/showdoc/567-lily

Start the test Lily instance (includes Lily, Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Solr):
  {lily-home}/lily-2.0/bin/launch-test-lily

Add the SCAPE Data Model to Lily:
  {lily-home}/lily-2.0/bin/lily-import {dc-lily-home}/dc-lily/scape_model.json

Deploy the dc-lily .war file to an application server (tested with Tomcat7) and start.
NOTE: the application will fail if the Lily instance is not started
NOTE: be sure that Tomcat is also running under Java 7

Use with the SCAPE Loader
=========================
It is necessary to compile the Loader (https://github.com/shaibe/loader-app) from source

Change the following line in Loader.java:
  LoaderApplication loaderapp = new LoaderApplication(conf, new EsciDocAuthentication(conf));
to
  LoaderApplication loaderapp = new LoaderApplication(conf);

(the open source version of Lily has no Authentication) then compile with
  mvn clean package -DskipTests

You can then load a set of METS files using:
  java -jar loader-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -d {testfile directory} -u dummy -p dummy -t 1 -r {servlet context}/dc-lily-0.1

Go to {servlet context}/dc-lily-0.1/monitor to monitor the progress of the ingest.
